//Explanation of the UDP Server Code
//DatagramSocket:
//
//A DatagramSocket is created on port 9876 to listen for incoming datagrams (packets) from clients.
//The server listens for incoming UDP packets without establishing a dedicated connection.
//Receiving Data:
//
//A DatagramPacket called receivePacket is created with a buffer receiveData to store incoming data from the client.
//        serverSocket.receive(receivePacket) waits until a packet is received from the client.
//        receivePacket.getData() retrieves the data as bytes, which is then converted to a String for easy reading.
//Preparing the Response:
//
//The server prepares a response message, "Hello from UDP Server!" and converts it into bytes using responseMessage.getBytes().
//Sending the Response:
//
//The server gets the clientâ€™s IP address and port from receivePacket to know where to send the response.
//It then creates a DatagramPacket named sendPacket with the response data, client address, and client port, and sends it using serverSocket.send(sendPacket).
//Closing the Socket:
//
//The server socket is closed after sending the response, which terminates the server.
